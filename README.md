# 2022romiClasses

This is an introduction to programming using the WPILib for the FRC using studio code.  We will be using the romi robot due to size and ease of use.  This is designed to teach the basics of java programming.  While creating confidence in your skill and ability. 



Thanks to czbeatty from github for the use of his classes using these programming classes.  I have updated these to use the newer libraries.
